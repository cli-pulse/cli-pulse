# CLI Pulse

CLI Pulse is a developer app for monitoring usage, quotas, resets, sessions,
and alerts across 50+ AI coding providers — and for remotely watching and
steering your Mac's AI-CLI agents from your phone. Available on macOS, iOS,
watchOS, and Android (beta).

This repository is the **public distribution and trust-documentation** repo
for CLI Pulse. It exists so users can:

- download official builds
- read the privacy, security, and terms documents
- find support contacts

It is **not** the product source code. CLI Pulse is closed-source commercial
software. See [License / All Rights Reserved](#license--all-rights-reserved)
below.

## What is CLI Pulse

CLI Pulse helps developers see — at a glance — how much of their AI provider
quotas they've used, what each provider is costing, when limits reset, and
which sessions are currently active. It supports 50+ providers, including
Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenRouter, Cursor, Copilot, JetBrains AI, Ollama,
Warp, and Augment.

It also turns your phone into a remote control for your Mac's coding agents:
pair the macOS app's local helper, then from iPhone or iPad watch your
managed AI-CLI sessions live, send prompts, approve or deny permission
requests, and keep an eye on a whole swarm of agents — without touching your
Mac.

The product spans:

- a macOS menu-bar app with a local helper
- an iOS / iPadOS / watchOS app
- an Android app (beta)

## Privacy summary

The full policy is in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and at
<https://jasonyeyuhe.github.io/cli-pulse/privacy.html>. The short version:

- **Provider API keys are never uploaded.** They are stored only in your
  device's secure store (macOS Keychain on Mac, iOS Keychain on iPhone,
  AndroidX EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android) and used directly against
  the provider's own API.
- **Provider session cookies are never uploaded.** Same handling as API keys.
- **Bridged OAuth tokens** read from local files such as `~/.codex/auth.json`,
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, and `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` stay on
  your device. They are shared between the sandboxed app and the local
  helper through the Keychain and never sent to CLI Pulse servers.
- **Raw session-log contents** under `~/.codex/sessions/` and
  `~/.claude/projects/` are scanned **on-device only**, after you grant
  folder access via security-scoped bookmarks. The file contents never leave
  your Mac.
- We do not ship any third-party product-analytics SDK (no Google Analytics,
  Firebase Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, or similar). Sentry is used for
  crash reports only and runs through a local scrubber that strips secrets,
  tokens, and `/Users/<name>` paths before any event is sent.

### What stays on-device

- provider API keys and session cookies
- bridged provider OAuth tokens
- the contents of local session logs
- security-scoped folder bookmarks
- locally-resolved alert suppression state

### What syncs to your CLI Pulse account

The data we sync is a small set of aggregated usage metrics and operational
metadata, kept to the minimum needed for cross-device viewing:

- provider name
- per-day token counts and request counts
- cost estimates derived locally
- quota / remaining / reset summaries
- session display metadata such as session name, status, and (minimized or
  hashed) project identifier
- device name, OS version, and helper version
- alerts that you choose to keep
- if you opt in to **Yield Score**: commit hash, an HMAC of the project
  path, the commit timestamp, and a merge-commit flag — never message,
  diff, file paths, or author identity

You can disable background sync, revoke folder access, or delete your
account at any time. See PRIVACY.md for the controls.
